      <p className="experienceParagraph">
        I am a full stack web developer from Virginia.
        I have spent over 9yrs in the field of music education, and I bring with me
        to this field, a passion for not only creativity but, analytical and
        reflective thinking. My primary instrument is the viola and I have been
        playing for over 20yrs getting to perform all over the country, and with
        major headlining talent. These experiences feed me and are what drives
        my interests in the ability to create and collaborate with others to
        design beautiful creations on the web. I am a military veteran through
        which I was able to experience other cultures and perspectives, as well as
        know what it means to be of service to others. When I'm not coding I am making music, spending time with loved ones, or enjoying some delicious home cooking. I love meeting new people and getting to talk about code so feel free to reach out.
