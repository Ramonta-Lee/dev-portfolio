        Hello, my name is Ramonta Lee. I am a full stack web developer with a
        strong interest in educational applications. My most notable strengths
        include JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Python, and Express. Having
        taught in a public educational setting for 9yrs, and served in the armed
        forces for 6yrs, I have learned to never give up no matter the
        challenges you may face. Working towards learning new things,
        creativity, and improving my skills has been at the heart of both
        professions. It is this curiosity and drive that I take with me into the
        world of web development. I want to continue to improve and utilize
        these skills in this field. When I'm not coding, I'm practicing my Viola
        and working on music, trying out new recipes, or spending time with
        loved ones. I love making new connections so if you'd like to know more
        or discuss ideas, please feel free to get in touch.
      </p>
