        I am a full stack web developer born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Most of my professional life has been spent in specialty retail and event management but I've always had an interest in technology and software development. I thoroughly enjoy identifying problems and opportunities for gains in efficiency then crafting solutions to those needs. In my free time you can find me gaming, working on person projects, and mentoring budding software developers. I also love meeting new people so I hope that we'll have a chance to become acquainted.
